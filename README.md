Android Text Manager
====================

Our goal is to make sending SMS and MMS easier on the Android OS.


Usage
-----
```java
mManager = TextManager.getInstance(context);
mManager.send(new Text.Builder()
                .message("HIII!!!!")
                .recipient("1234567890")
                .attach(bmp1)
                .attach(bmp2)
                .attach(bmp3)
                .build()
);
```
