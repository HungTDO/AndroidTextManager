Android Text Manager
====================

Our goal is to make sending SMS and MMS easier on the Android OS.


Download
--------
```groovy
dependencies {
  compile 'com.xlythe:android-text-manager:0.0.2'
}
```

Usage
-----
First thing to do is grab an instance of TextManager
```java
TextManager manager = TextManager.getInstance(context);
```

To get a list of conversations aka "threads"
```java
List<Thread> threads = manager.getThreads().get();
```

You can also get a cursor of threads
```java
Thread.ThreadCursor cursor = manager.getThreadCursor();
```

With a thread you can get the latest message and get more info from there
```java
Text text = thread.getLatestMessage(context).get();
text.getThreadId()
text.getTimestamp();
text.getBody();
text.getAttachment();
text.sender();
text.getMembersExceptMe(context).get();
// and the list goes on...
```

To simply send a message all that is needed is to:
- use Text Builder to build your message
- and send using TextManger
```java
manager.send(new Text.Builder()
                .message("HIII!!!!")
                .recipient("1234567890")
                .attach(new ImageAttachment(uri))
                .attach(new VideoAttachment(uri))
                .build()
);
```

In order to reply to a thread of messages given a thread id (This handles group messaging):
- use TextManager to grab the Thread
- get the latest message in the thread using getLatestMessage
- get all the members in the conversation minus yourself
```java
// There are a few ways to do this.
// This example uses callbacks, but you can get all the same data for the Builder from the methods above
Thread thread = manager.getThread(id).get()
thread.getLatestMessage(context).get(new Future.Callback<Text>() {
            @Override
            public void get(Text instance) {
                instance.getMembersExceptMe(context).get(new Future.Callback<Set<Contact>>() {
                    @Override
                    public void get(Set<Contact> instance) {
                        manager.send(new Text.Builder()
                                .message("HIII!!!!")
                                .addRecipients(instance)
                                .build());
                    }
                });
            }
        });
```
